1. A user should be able to trigger the "fork" from a browser (e.g. clicking on a
link)

Github account
3. Ensure your code is deploy ready

### Technical:
1. Python 3.7 or the language of your choice utilizing a framework of your choice
2. Include instructions on how to run the solution locally.

# Author Notes:
- Chose Python 3.8 has that version was already on my system.  Downgrading to an earlier version carried a risk of breaking other projects.  Selecting Python 3.8 allowed under 'language of choice' under Technical.
- Google Search found existing code to perform the same function
--  GNU General Public License allows for this usage
